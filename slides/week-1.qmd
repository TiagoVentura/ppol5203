# Welcome to Data Science I {background-color="#447099"}

## Plans for Today

-   Motivating [Data Science for Public Policy]{.blue}.

-   Goals of the course

-   Introductions

-   Course Logistics

-   IDEs

    -   Jupyter

-   Introduction to commandline

# Motivation: Digital Information Age {background-color="#447099"}

## Abundance of data

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/digital.jpeg") 
```

## Powerful and Cheap Computing Power

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/collab.png") 
```

## World of Generative AI Models

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("https://diplo-media.s3.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/2025/03/openai-chatgpt-surge-deepseek.jpg") 
```

## As a consequence, we live in a world:

::: nonincremental

:::fragment
-  **With** abundance of data we can use for research and to recommend policy decisions:
   
   - Internet data, social media, geo-tracking tools, etc...
:::

:::fragment
-  **With** easily available technologies to analyze this data at scale

   - Your laptops, cloud computing, ChatBots...
:::

:::fragment
-  **But** with new technologies that also have novel social implications:

    -   Privacy issues

    -   Use of technology by bad actors.

    -   Use of technology by governments to censor/monitor citizens.
:::

:::fragment
-   Policy scholars (but pretty much any researcher) need to be equipped to properly **work** with this data  and **understand** the effects of these news technologies
:::
:::
## Data Science for Public Policy

[Data Scientist for Public Policy]{.red} focuses on **computational approaches** to solve/understand **policy problems**.

-   It is part of a larger and new field called [computational social science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science)

:::nonincremental

:::fragment
-   **Social science** 

    -   Understands human behavior: human psychology, language, economic behavior, political systems, policy problems
    -   Involve many **approaches**: qualitative interviews, statistical analysis, simulations
:::

:::fragment
-   **Data Science**:

    -   Tools to work with large-scale data + learning models + novel data sources
:::

# Computational Social Science in Practice

## Misinformation on WhatsApp

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/whatsappmotivation.png") 
```

## Data Donation WhatsApp Groups

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/wpp.png") 
```

## All the steps + Tools `....` so far `...`

-   [Step 1]{.blue}: Recruiting participants online (SS)

    -   Online Panels + Facebook Ads

-   [Step 2]{.blue}: Running online surveys (SS)

    -   Qualtrics + R

-   [Step 3]{.blue}: Development of data donation pipeline (with MDI) (DS/CS)

    -   JavaScript (JS) + Python

-   [Step 4]{.blue}: Analyze the data (SS/DS)

    -   SQL + Python + R

## Readings for this week

-   Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age By Mathew Salganik

     -   [Introduction](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/introduction/)

     -   [Observing Behavior](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/observing-behavior/)

-   [Training Computational Social Science PhD Students for Academic and Non-Academic Careers](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/training-computational-social-science-phd-students-for-academic-and-nonacademic-careers/1455690939833B9FFCAC664D4E412057) - Written by me and some colleagues in academia, industry and non-profits

## Goals of the course

<br>

The goal of this course is to teach you:

-   **Computational thinking**: how to approach problems and devise solutions from a computational perspective.

-   Get you started on **Python**, introduce some useful tools (scrapping, text analysis and API applications of GenAI models), and bit of **SQL** for applied data science; lay the foundations for the remainder of the core DS sequence

-   **Workflows and tools:** Git/Github + Commandline.

## Quiz! {background-color="#447099"}

### Which programming language did I use the most at?

-   PhD

-   Postdoc

-   Twitter

-   As a Faculty

## A comment from the pre-course survey (from last year)

> Hi professor Ventura! I noticed that we gonna learn multiple data analysis tool this semester and I am definitely a novice of data science. I am little worried about how can I master all of them without being confused, because some commands might be very similar.

-   The project is composed of three parts:

    -   a 2 page project proposal: (which should be discussed and approved by me)
    -   an in-class presentation,
    -   A 10-page project report.

| Project Report   | December 16 | 10 pages      | 25%            |

## GenAI

You are allowed to use GenAI as you would use google in this class. This means:

-   Do not copy the responses from GenAI Chatbots -- a lot of them are wrong or will just not run on your computer

-   Use GenAI Chatbots as a auxiliary source.

-   If your entire homework comes straight from GenAI Chatbots, I will consider it plagiarism.

-   If you use GenAI Chatbots, I ask you to mention on your code how chatgpt worked for you.

# [Be mature and make smart decisions. You will not be able to cheat on a coding interview, remember you are a master student now!]{.red}

# Let's take a break!

          left = 0, right = 0,

# `r fontawesome::fa("book-open")` Survey Results

## Summary of the survey

-   Most of you have [some]{.red} experience with Python.

-   [Very few]{.red} of you were using primarily Python in your work before!

    -   Most others are using R and Excel!

-   Most of you have Python in your laptops, some still do not have a github account. If you are having issues after today, talk to your TAs.

-   Main Policy Areas:

    -   Social Media/Tech (Talk to me!)
    -   Election (Talk to Professor Warshaw, Bailey or Ladd)
    -   Education (Talk with Professor Johnson)

## Open Ended

- this is a big group of international students, and some are concerned about not having english as you first language!
  
    - THIS IS FINE ! I hope my non-native and strongly accented English will encourage you to participate in class and speak up!

::: fragment
>"That's just what translation is, I think. That's all speaking is. Listening to the other and trying to see past your own biases to glimpse what they're trying to say. Showing yourself to the world, and hoping someone else understands."
- R.F. Kuang, Babel
:::



## Open Ended

Some of you are slightly anxious about Python and the pace of the class

::: incremental

   -   Python is definitely harder than excel and stata.

   -   But you will be fine!

   -   **Our approach**: We start slow, cover the basics, and move fast!
