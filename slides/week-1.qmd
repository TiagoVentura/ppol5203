-   Goals of the course

-   Introductions

-   Course Logistics

-   IDEs

    -   Jupyter
    -   Quarto

-   Introduction to commandline

# Why are we here? {background-color="#447099"}

## Rise of the digital information age

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "50%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/digital.jpeg") 
```

:::

## Powerful and Cheap Computer Power

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/collab.png") 
```

## As a consequence:

-   Abundance of data we can use for research and governments can use to make better decisions

    -   Novel research questions

    -   New ways to answer old, long-standing research questions

-   New technologies also have social implications and can generate important policy questions.

    -   Privacy issues

    -   Use of technology by bad actors.

    -   Use of technology by governments to censor/monitor citizens.

    -   etc...

-   Policy scholars (but pretty much any researcher) need to be equipped to properly deal with these challenges

## Data Science for Public Policy

[Data Scientist for Public Policy]{.red} focuses on **computational approaches** to solve/understand **Policy Problems**.

-   Part of a larger and new field called [computational social sciente](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_social_science)

-   But with a more [policy-focus]{.red}.

-   **What is social science?** It refers to a domain of study - social phenomena:

    -   Encompasses many **scales**: human psychology, language, economic behavior, political systems, policy problems
    -   Involve many **approaches**: qualitative interviews, statistical analysis, simulations

-   **What is Data Science?**:

    -   Use often large-scale data + algorithms to answer questions

## An example: Data Donation WhatsApp Groups

```{r  echo=FALSE, out.width = "100%", fig.align="center"}
knitr::include_graphics("week1_figs/wpp.png") 
```

## All the steps + Tools `....` so far `...`

-   [Step 1]{.blue}: Recruiting participants online

    -   Online Panels + Facebook Ads

-   [Step 2]{.blue}: Running online surveys

    -   Qualtrics + R

-   [Step 3]{.blue}: Development of data donation pipeline (with MDI)

    -   JavaScript (JS) + Python

-   [Step 4]{.blue}: Analyze the data

    -   SQL + Python + R

## Readings for this week

-   **Bit by Bit: Social Research in the Digital Age** By Mathew Salganik

-   [Introduction](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/introduction/)

-   [Observing Behavior](https://www.bitbybitbook.com/en/1st-ed/observing-behavior/)

-   [Training Computational Social Science PhD Students for Academic and Non-Academic Careers](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/ps-political-science-and-politics/article/training-computational-social-science-phd-students-for-academic-and-nonacademic-careers/1455690939833B9FFCAC664D4E412057) - Written by me and some colleagues in academia, industry and non-profits

## Goals of the course

<br>

The goal of this course is to teach you:

-   **Computational thinking**: how to approach problems and devise solutions from a computational perspective.

-   Get you started on **Python** and a bit of **SQL** for applied data science; lay the foundations for the remainder of the core sequence

-   **Workflows and tools:** Git/Github + Commandline.

## A comment from the pre-course survey (from last year)

> Hi professor Ventura! I noticed that we gonna learn multiple data analysis tool this semester and I am definitely a novice of data science. I am little worried about how can I master all of them without being confused, because some commands might be very similar.

## ChatGPT

You are allowed to use ChatGPT as you would use google in this class. This means:

-   Do not copy the responses from chatgpt -- a lot of them are wrong or will just not run on your computer

-   Use chatgpt as a auxiliary source.

-   If your entire homework comes straight from chatgpt, I will consider it plagiarism.

-   If you use chatgpt, I ask you to mention on your code how chatgpt worked for you.

# `r fontawesome::fa("book-open")` Survey Results

## Summary of the survey

-   72% of you have [some]{.red} experience with Python.

-   [Only three]{.red} of you were using primarily Python in your work before!

    -   Most others are using R and Excel!

-   You all have Python in your laptops, some still do not have a github account. If you are having issue after today, talk to your TAs.

-   Main Policy Areas:

    -   Social Media/Tech (Talk to me!)
    -   Election (aha! great timing for it!)
    -   Education (Talk with Professor Johnson)

## Open Ended

-   Most of you are worried, slightly anxious Python is hard, and you will not be able to keep up.

::: incremental
-   Python is definitely harder than excel and stata.

-   But you will be fine!

-   **Our approach**: We start slow, cover the basics, and move fast!
