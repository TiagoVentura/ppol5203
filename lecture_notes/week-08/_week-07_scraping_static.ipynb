    "## Ethical Challenges with Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "Webscraping is legal **as long as the scraped data is publicly available and the scraping activity does not harm the website being scraped**. These are two hugely relevant conditionals.  For this reason, before we start coding, it is carefully understand what each entails. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each call to a web server takes time, server cycles, and memory. Most servers can handle significant traffic, but they can't necessarily handle the strain induced by massive automated requests. Your code can overload the site, taking it offline, or causing the site administrator to ban your IP. See [Denial-of-service attack (DoS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack).\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not want compromise the functioning of a website just because of our research. First, this overload can crash a server and prevent other users from accessing the site. Second, servers and hosters can, and do, implement countermeasures (i.e. block our access from our IP and so on). \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, take as a best practice of only collecting public information. Think about Facebook. In my personal view, it is okay to collect public posts, or data from public groups. If by some way you manage to get into private groups, and group members have an expectation of privacy, it is not okay to collect their data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of good practices for scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Respect robots.txt\n",
    "- Don't hit servers too often\n",
    "- Slow down your code to the speed humans would manually do\n",
    "- Find trusted source sites\n",
    "- Do not shave during peak hours\n",

       " 'text': 'The last time Bernie Sanders headlined a rally in Queens it was 2019, he was trying to reenergize his presidential campaign after a heart attack, and Zohran Mamdani was asking attendees to sign petitions for his first assembly run.\\nOn Sunday afternoon, the Vermont senator is expected to help fill a stadium in Queens for Mamdani in the hopes of powering him to a strong finish in his bid to be New York City mayor.\\nDuring his campaign, Mamdani has echoed the same working-class-focused message used by Sanders more than three decades ago when he first ran for mayor of Burlington, Vermont.\\n“He said when he was running to be the mayor of Burlington, that Burlington is not for sale,” Mamdani told CNN in an exclusive interview on Sunday. “It continues to be the rallying cry for working class people across this country, and for us, it’s that New York City is not for sale.”\\nThe rally’s slogan, “New York Is Not for Sale,” is a dig at the vocal wealthy New Yorkers, including people like Bill Ackman and John Catsimatidis, who have been speaking out in opposition to Mamdani’s candidacy, and in many cases also donating to the super PAC that is aligned with Cuomo.\\n“We have the same billionaires who funded Donald Trump’s campaign funding Andrew Cuomo’s, and whether it be Bill Ackman or the Waltons, people who think they can look at a city like ours, they can appraise it and they can buy it,” Mamdani said.\\nRep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez will be at the rally, too, as Mamdani heads into the final week of this surprising campaign trying to emphasize the energy and firm rooting on the left that powered him from 1% in the polls in the spring to potentially winning city hall.\\nAs he heads into the last stretch before the general election now that early voting in NYC has begun, Mamdani is also trying to signal a united front amongst Democrats – showing that his agenda has the backing of the three most powerful lawmakers in the state.\\nMamdani will be joined on stage Sunday by Governor Kathy Hochul, marking the first time the two campaign together. Also on stage will be State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie. The trio of lawmakers are often referred to as “the three people in the room,” – a nod to their legislative, budgetary and executive power.\\n“It shows that this is not just an agenda that is principled, it’s not just one that’s popular, it’s one that’s possible,” Mamdani said.\\nHochul has said she would not support raising taxes on the wealthy to pay for Mandani’s proposals, but she has embraced his universal childcare proposal and signaled she would find a way to fund the program without raising taxes.\\nMamdani will need the trio’s legislative support to enact major parts of his agenda if he is elected in November, and while he referred to them as “partners,” Mamdani has not yet endorsed Hochul in her own race next year. The governor will likely face a challenge from Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik, who recently referred to Mamdani as a “Communist jihadist.”\\n“I have appreciated my relationship with the governor,” Mamdani said. “The governor hasn’t yet asked me for that endorsement, and what I’m focused on right now is these next 9 days running through the tape, and then building that relationship with the governor.”\\nWhen he takes the stage on Sunday, Mamdani is expected to keep hitting the three central themes of his campaign: freezing rents, making buses free and expanding universal childcare.\\nMamdani is still trying to broaden his support across a party which remains divided on how to fight back against President Donald Trump. On Friday he welcomed the long-withheld backing of Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, the House Democratic leader and Brooklyn congressman. Jeffries endorsed Mamdani while making it clear the two had political differences.\\nMamdani, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America said Sunday he “appreciated the work” Jeffries is doing around the government shutdown and trying to prevent millions of Americans from losing access to health care. He also stopped short of backing any challenge to the House Minority leader which Mamdani’s allies in DSA have called for.\\n“I am not having that conversation. I’m not thinking about that,” Mamdani said. “I appreciate the conversations with Congressman Jeffries as it comes back to affordability, our shared constituents, and the fact that in as much as we have to fight authoritarianism, we also have to fight for a democracy that New Yorkers see as being able to deliver on their material needs.”\\nThe capacity of the theater where Mamdani held his last big rally two weeks ago was just over 3,000. In a sign of the Mamdani campaign’s confidence about his momentum, Forest Hills Stadium’s capacity, where Sunday night’s rally with Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez will be held, is 13,000. And just like that last rally, held in Manhattan’s Washington Heights neighborhood, putting this rally outside the usual circuit of Manhattan venues is itself a representative choice of how Mamdani is pitching himself.\\nAndrew Cuomo, running as an independent after losing to Mamdani in June’s Democratic primary, has never held any kind of rally – nor has Republican nominee Curtis Sliwa.'}"

       " 'text': 'The CNN poll conducted by SSRS was designed to offer a deep-dive look at the different types of independents that make up this critical group in American politics.\\nThe survey was conducted both online and by telephone from August 21 through September 1. The 2,077 adults who took the poll were selected from two sample sources – the SSRS Opinion Panel and a list of registered voters, including some who had previously taken a CNN survey conducted in April. The survey included 1,006 political independents, defined as people who said they were independents or did not identify with either major political party. The sample was designed to include a larger than usual number of political independents in order to get a more reliable picture of their views. It was then weighted to partisan benchmarks obtained from CNN’s May 2025 national survey so that each party represents its proper share within the full adult results. The full sample was also weighted to demographic and other benchmarks to ensure that it is representative of the adult population.\\nIndependents’ answers to the survey questions were combined to create five different scales assessing the depth of respondents’ connections to the Democratic and Republican parties, their level of political engagement, their confidence in the political system, the extent to which they feel represented by the political system and their degree of openness to both Democrats and Republicans. Those scales were used as part of a statistical technique called K-means cluster analysis – which groups together respondents with similar answers across all five scales into separate groups – to create the five resulting subgroups of independents.\\nThe project took inspiration from a 2007 Washington Post/KFF/Harvard School of Public Health project which also segmented political independents using similar techniques. Several questions from the 2007 survey were repeated in the new poll. Three of the resulting groups in the new project are similar to those found in 2007. The other two are quite different, likely reflecting the significant changes in the American political climate over that time.\\nResults for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points. Among the sample of 1,006 independents, the error margin is +/-4.2 points. The margin of sampling error for results among the five subgroups of independents ranges from +/-7.9 percentage points to +/-10.7 points.'}"

       " 'story_date': 'Updated Oct 25, 2025, 7:00 AM ET\\nPublished Oct 25, 2025, 7:00 AM ET\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPUBLISHED Oct 25, 2025, 7:00 AM ET',\n",
       " 'text': 'If there’s one former president whom Donald Trump has elevated during Trump 2.0, it’s Grover Cleveland.\\nThe only other president to serve nonconsecutive terms (Cleveland was #22 and #24 to Trump’s #45 and #47), Cleveland is also, like Trump, associated with tariffs.\\nThe actual history is a bit more complicated, as we’ve seen in previous reports on Cleveland, who is also notable for having married his much younger former ward — the daughter of his dead former law partner — in the White House.\\nThe tariffs Cleveland is known for are something he pushed for as a congressman and later, as president, began to turn against.\\nTrump invoked another similarity at the White House recently when he noted that Cleveland is among the presidents to have called up US troops for operations within the United States.\\nBut the circumstances were so different as to defy comparison, even though Cleveland’s call-up of US troops relied on the 1792 Insurrection Act, a law Trump has suggested he could utilize in the future.\\nTrump has foisted National Guard troops on unwilling locals in cities run by Democrats in part to assist with his mass deportation effort. Cleveland, by contrast, did so to put down anti-immigrant race riots.\\nI talked by email to Princeton history professor Beth Lew-Williams, author of The Chinese Must Go: Violence, Exclusion, and the Making of the Alien in America, to learn more about why Cleveland sent troops to Tacoma and Seattle in the 19th century.\\nOur conversation, edited for length and formatting, is below.\\nWOLF: President Donald Trump invoked Grover Cleveland to justify the domestic deployment of US troops. Most people won’t be familiar with those incidents, involving anti-Chinese riots in Tacoma and Seattle in the late 1800s. What’s the basic storyline around why Cleveland sent US troops to Washington state?\\nLEW-WILLIAMS: In 1885 and 1886, anti-Chinese fervor swept the American West. American workingmen, fearful of labor competition from Chinese immigrants, called for their immediate expulsion. When white coal miners in Rock Springs, Wyoming, massacred 28 Chinese immigrants on September 2, 1885, the Territorial Gov. Francis E. Warren called on President Grover Cleveland to send federal troops to prevent further violence. Under the watchful gaze of US soldiers, Chinese survivors were able to return to Rock Springs and rebuild.\\nA few months later, on November 3, 1885, agitators in Tacoma, Washington Territory, drove out more than 300 Chinese immigrants, and agitators in Seattle threatened to follow. On the request of Chinese merchants and the Territorial Gov. Watson C. Squire, President Cleveland sent troops to prevent the expulsion of Chinese from Seattle. Troops were stationed in Seattle for 10 days in 1885, and again in 1886 for seven months. President Cleveland’s response is one of the reasons that Seattle still has a Chinatown today.\\nWOLF: Cleveland sent in troops to put down anti-Chinese riots where Trump is sending in troops, at least in Los Angeles, to help facilitate deportations. Is that the right way to compare the two examples — as opposites?\\nLEW-WILLIAMS: President Cleveland deployed troops to protect Chinese immigrants and reestablish peace. The troops did not entirely prevent the expulsion of Chinese immigrants from Seattle — hundreds were driven out in the spring of 1886 — (but) the soldiers helped to prevent the escalation of anti-immigrant violence.\\nWOLF: What happened to the Chinese population in the western US after the riots in Seattle and Tacoma? Did most Chinese immigrants leave the US or did they move to other cities?\\nLEW-WILLIAMS: Anti-Chinese vigilantes successfully drove out all the Chinese immigrants — perhaps as many as 800 people — from Tacoma. More than 200 Chinese left Seattle under duress. Many remained in the United States, finding relative safety in Portland, San Francisco or the Eastern states. Others fled to Canada or China.\\nWOLF: Anti-Chinese violence was frequently carried out by European immigrants who saw the Chinese as competition. Were there any restrictions on the inflow of European immigrants at the time?\\nLEW-WILLIAMS: Through a series of laws starting in 1882, Congress barred the vast majority of Chinese from immigrating to the United States. The Chinese Exclusion Act explicitly rejected Chinese immigrants on the bases of their race and class. Chinese Exclusion had a profound effect on the Chinese American community, separating families and stunting generations.\\nWhile Congress also placed restrictions on other immigrants, these restrictions are not comparable in scale or effect. In the 1880s, US immigration law restricted immigrants from Europe if they were “likely to become a public charge” (too poor to support themselves) or contract laborers. These restrictions had limited impact on arrival of immigrants from Europe.\\nWOLF: When did the overt racism of US law excluding Asian immigrants end?\\nLEW-WILLIAMS: Chinese Exclusion came to a formal end in 1943. But US immigration law continued to explicitly discriminate against Asian immigrants until the passage of the 1965 Immigration Act.'}"
