    "## Ethical Challenges with Scraping\n",
    "\n",
    "Webscraping is legal **as long as the scraped data is publicly available and the scraping activity does not harm the website being scraped**. These are two hugely relevant conditionals.  For this reason, before we start coding, it is carefully understand what each entails. \n",
    "\n",
    "Each call to a web server takes time, server cycles, and memory. Most servers can handle significant traffic, but they can't necessarily handle the strain induced by massive automated requests. Your code can overload the site, taking it offline, or causing the site administrator to ban your IP. See [Denial-of-service attack (DoS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack).\n",
    "\n",
    "We do not want compromise the functioning of a website just because of our research. First, this overload can crash a server and prevent other users from accessing the site. Second, servers and hosters can, and do, implement countermeasures (i.e. block our access from our IP and so on). \n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, take as a best practice of only collecting public information. Think about Facebook. In my personal view, it is okay to collect public posts, or data from public groups. If by some way you manage to get into private groups, and group members have an expectation of privacy, it is not okay to collect their data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a list of good practices for scraping:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Respect robots.txt\n",
    "- Don't hit servers too often\n",
    "- Slow down your code to the speed humans would manually do\n",
    "- Find trusted source sites\n",
    "- Do not shave during peak hours\n",

       " 'As New Yorkers cast their ballots in the city’s mayoral race, Democratic mayoral nominee Zohran Mamdani sent a message to voters Sunday, asking them not to choose “settling for the lesser of two evils,” warning his supporters to not take his double-digit lead in the polls as a guarantee.\\n“While Donald Trump’s donor billionaires think they have the money to buy this election, we have a movement of the masses,” Mamdani said to a roaring crowd.\\nMamdani took the stage at a raucous rally alongside Sen. Bernie Sanders and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez at Forest Hills Stadium in Queens, where thousands of people chanted Mamdani’s name and repeated in unison his signature proposals to freeze the rent, make buses fast and free, and provide universal child care.\\nThe rally was part closing argument, part rallying of the troops ahead of the November 4 election, with Mamdani casting the race as a choice between democracy and oligarchy and Sanders and Ocasio Cortez touting Mamdani’s campaign as the vanguard of a progressive movement itching to push back on the second Trump administration.\\n“I’m talking to you, Donald Trump,” Ocasio-Cortez declared, saying that “in nine short days we will work our hearts out to elect Zohran Kwame Mamdani as the next mayor of the great city of New York.”\\nSanders, speaking in the Brooklyn accent he’s never shed, told the crowd Trump and “the rest of the world” were watching the election.\\n“A victory here in New York will give hope and inspiration to people throughout our country and throughout the world,” the Vermont senator said. “That is what this election is about, and that is why Donald Trump is paying attention to this election.”\\nAfter walking out to a roaring crowd and thumping Desi beat, a beaming Mamdani credited Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders, in particular, for inspiring the progressive movement that’s become the backbone of his campaign.\\n“I stand before you tonight, only because the senator dared to stand alone for so long. I speak the language of democratic socialism, only because he spoke it first,” Mamdani said. “And when we win on November 4 and then govern from City Hall with dignity as the foundation of our politics, it will be because of the movement that Bernie built.”\\nThe trio of leaders repeatedly nationalized the high-stakes New York mayoral contest, with Sanders remarking that “these are not normal times, this is not a normal election.” Each threaded calls to action against Republicans with critiques of the Democratic Party.\\n“While Donald Trump’s billionaire donors think that they have the money to buy this election, we have a movement of the masses,” Mamdani said. “No longer will we allow the Republican Party to be the one of ambition. No longer will we have to open a history book to read about Democrats leading with big ideas.”\\nOcasio-Cortez argued that “the very forces that Zohran is up against in this race mirrors what we are up against nationally, both an authoritarian criminal presidency, fueled by corruption and bigotry and an ascendant right-wing extremist movement.”\\nThe New York representative castigated the “insufficient, eroded, bygone political establishment, this time in the form of Andrew Cuomo.”\\nThe rally, though, reflected efforts to form a bridge between the upstart progressives and a wary Democratic establishment. Mamdani was also joined by New York Gov. Kathy Hochul — who endorsed his campaign just last month — as well as State Senate Majority Leader Andrea Stewart-Cousins and State Assembly Speaker Carl Heastie, a show of support in the closing stretch of the divisive race.\\n“Any person who wants to the mayor of the city in New York, to have three people you probably have to work with the most” showing support gives Mamdani “momentum into trying to achieve his agenda,” Heastie told CNN at the rally.\\nAddressing the crowd, Hochul echoed that sentiment. “The three of us can’t do it alone. We need a fighter in City Hall, who wakes up every day, ready to punch and fight for the working people of the city, and that person is Zohran Mamdani,” she said, repeatedly interrupted by chants of “tax the rich.”\\nHochul has said she opposes Mamdani’s plan to tax the wealthy. With her own election next year, Hochul will be under pressure to deliver for Mamdani if he wins, but also to keep taxes from increasing. As the shouts continued through her speech, Mamdani came onstage and embraced her before the two walked off together.\\nHochul also praised Mamdani for showing “grace, and courage and grit” during his campaign and criticized “Islamophobia and bigotry and hate-filled speech” directed his way.\\n“That kind of bullsh*t doesn’t belong in New York,” the governor told the fired-up crowd.\\nThe rowdy atmosphere was underscored by New York Comptroller Brad Lander — a former primary rival of Mamdani who quickly threw his support behind the upstart progressive — reprising a rousing condemnation of former Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who’s running as an independent, and the anti-Mamdani coalition.\\n“We had to send that corrupt, abusive bully Andrew Cuomo back to the suburbs. I said it on election night and I can’t wait to say it again next Tuesday — good f**king riddance!” Lander said.\\nThe rally’s slogan, “New York Is Not for Sale,” was a dig at the vocal wealthy New Yorkers, including Bill Ackman and John Catsimatidis, who have been speaking out in opposition to Mamdani’s candidacy, and in many cases donating to the super PAC aligned with Cuomo.\\n“We have the same billionaires who funded Donald Trump’s campaign funding Andrew Cuomo’s, and whether it be Bill Ackman or the Waltons, people who think they can look at a city like ours, they can appraise it and they can buy it,” Mamdani told CNN in an exclusive interview Sunday.\\nHe noted the rally’s slogan was a callback to Sanders’ own mayoral campaign in Burlington, Vermont, three decades ago.\\n“He said when he was running to be the mayor of Burlington, that Burlington is not for sale,” Mamdani said. “It continues to be the rallying cry for working-class people across this country, and for us, it’s that New York City is not for sale.”\\nThe rally came amid a surge in early voting turnout, with more than five times as many New Yorkers voting during the first weekend of early in-person voting for this year’s mayoral election compared with four years ago.\\nData released Sunday by the New York City Board of Elections shows 164,190 people voted this weekend. During the first weekend of early voting in 2021 — the first mayoral election where it was an option — only 31,176 people voted.\\nThis story and headline have been updated with additional developments.\\nCNN’s Ethan Cohen contributed to this report.']"

       " 'text': 'The CNN poll conducted by SSRS was designed to offer a deep-dive look at the different types of independents that make up this critical group in American politics.\\nThe survey was conducted both online and by telephone from August 21 through September 1. The 2,077 adults who took the poll were selected from two sample sources – the SSRS Opinion Panel and a list of registered voters, including some who had previously taken a CNN survey conducted in April. The survey included 1,006 political independents, defined as people who said they were independents or did not identify with either major political party. The sample was designed to include a larger than usual number of political independents in order to get a more reliable picture of their views. It was then weighted to partisan benchmarks obtained from CNN’s May 2025 national survey so that each party represents its proper share within the full adult results. The full sample was also weighted to demographic and other benchmarks to ensure that it is representative of the adult population.\\nIndependents’ answers to the survey questions were combined to create five different scales assessing the depth of respondents’ connections to the Democratic and Republican parties, their level of political engagement, their confidence in the political system, the extent to which they feel represented by the political system and their degree of openness to both Democrats and Republicans. Those scales were used as part of a statistical technique called K-means cluster analysis – which groups together respondents with similar answers across all five scales into separate groups – to create the five resulting subgroups of independents.\\nThe project took inspiration from a 2007 Washington Post/KFF/Harvard School of Public Health project which also segmented political independents using similar techniques. Several questions from the 2007 survey were repeated in the new poll. Three of the resulting groups in the new project are similar to those found in 2007. The other two are quite different, likely reflecting the significant changes in the American political climate over that time.\\nResults for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 2.7 percentage points. Among the sample of 1,006 independents, the error margin is +/-4.2 points. The margin of sampling error for results among the five subgroups of independents ranges from +/-7.9 percentage points to +/-10.7 points.'}"
